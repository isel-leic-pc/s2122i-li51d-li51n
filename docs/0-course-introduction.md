# Concurrent Programming course introduction

## Goals

In summary, provide the knowledge and skills required to design and implement applications over multi-threaded and asynchronous programming models, with emphasis on the concurrency and coordination aspects.

See [_ficha de unidade curricular_](https://www.isel.pt/disciplinas/programacao-concorrente-leic).

## Programme

- Introduction to multi-threaded models and concurrent programming.
- Design of custom synchronizers using monitors on the JVM and .NET plataforms.
- Memory models and lock-free algorithms and data structures.
- Asynchronous I/O and asynchronous programming models on the JVM platform and the .NET platform.

See [calendar.md](calendar.md) for a more detailed programme, including *relevant dates*.
